I created 3 linked clones named RADIUS, GATEWAY and RW_ALICE.
On base isp virtual machine i ran sudo apt update and:
sudo apt-get install openssh-server apache2 curl git
sudo apt install strongswan strongswan-pki libcharon-extra-plugins apache2 wireshark
sudo apt install freeradius freeradius-utils apache2 libapache2-mod-auth-radius wireshark

That way the linked clones had these programs already installed.


On RADIUS i made 1 network adapter in the internal network intnet.

On GATEWAY i created 2 network adapters, 1 in internal network called intnet and the other was in NatNetwork, which i created in file/preferences/networks/natnetworks.

On RW_ALICE i made 1 network adapter type NatNetwork.





1.Gateway network:

GATEWAY Config:
i ran:
sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml

to configure network interfaces, where i included:
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp-identifier: mac
    enp0s8:
      addresses: [172.16.0.1/24]

After that to apply these settings i ran:
sudo netplan apply

Then i also ran:
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
The above command enables routing, which we will need.
To enable nat masquerading i ran:
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o enp0s3 -j MASQUERADE

test:
ping google.com

RADIUS config:
i ran:
sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml

to configure network interfaces, where i included:
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:
      addresses: [172.16.0.2/24]
      gateway4: 172.16.0.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8]

After that to apply these settings i ran:
sudo netplan apply

Then i tested with ping 172.16.0.1 and ping google.com.

RW_ALICE config:
i ran:
sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml

to configure network interfaces, where i included:
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp-identifier: mac

After that to apply these settings i ran:
sudo netplan apply

Then i tested with ping 10.0.2.4 (GATEWAY) and ping google.com.





2.Radius:
On RADIUS machine i ran:
sudo nano /etc/freeradius/3.0/clients.conf
In this file i inserted:
client gateway {
    ipaddr = 172.16.0.1
    secret = radiuspassword
    require_message_authenticator = no
    nas_type = other
}

After i saved the changes i ran:
sudo nano /etc/freeradius/3.0/users

In this i inserted:
"alice" Cleartext-Password := "alice"

Then i stopped the service with:
sudo service freeradius stop

After i started the server with:
sudo freeradius -X -d /etc/freeradius/3.0

And on Machine GATEWAY i tested it by running:
echo "User-Name=alice, User-Password=alice" | radclient 172.16.0.2 auth radiuspassword -x
The command returned Access-Accept which means it was configured correctly.




3 Gateway firewall:
on GATEWAY i ran:
git clone https://github.com/lem-course/isp-iptables.git
After that:
chmod +x handson-tables.sh
Then:
sudo nano ./handson-tables.sh

I added the lines below (comments tell what for):

#Allow all incoming packets that belong to ESTABLISHED or RELATED connections.
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

#allow all routed traffic to pass through
iptables -A FORWARD -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

#Nat translations
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o enp0s3 -j MASQUERADE

#incoming and outgoing pings (ICMP)
iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT

#dns outgoing
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT

#ISAKMP incoming
iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 500 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 4500 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT

#IPsec(ESP) incoming
iptables -A INPUT -p esp -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT

To apply:
sudo ./handson-tables.sh start
Then i tested with pings from RADIUS to google.com and gateway ip.
I also tested with NAS auth request from GATEWAY to RADIUS with command:

To remove the rules before continuing i applied:
sudo ./handson-tables.sh stop




4. Gateway VPN:
On GATEWAY virtual machine i ran:
sudo nano /etc/ipsec.conf
Inside, i inserted:
conn %default
        ikelifetime=60m
        keylife=20m
        rekeymargin=3m
        keyingtries=1
        keyexchange=ikev2
        authby=secret

conn net-net
        leftsubnet=172.16.0.0/24
        leftfirewall=yes
        leftid=gw
	leftauth=psk
	rightauth=eap-radius
	rightsubnet=172.16.1.0/24
        right=%any
        auto=add


Then i changed the file:
sudo nano /etc/ipsec.secrets
Where i inserted:
gw : PSK "mypsk"

I restarted the service with:
sudo ipsec restart

Then i went on to RW_ALICE virtual machine, where i ran:
sudo nano /etc/ipsec.conf
Inside, i inserted:
conn %default
        ikelifetime=60m
        keylife=20m
        rekeymargin=3m
        keyingtries=1
        keyexchange=ikev2
        authby=secret

conn net-net
        leftsubnet=172.16.1.0/24
	rightsubnet=172.16.0.0/24
	rightid=gw
	rightfirewall=yes
        right=%any
        auto=add


I restarted the service with:
sudo ipsec restart

To test the connection you write:
sudo ipsec up net-net

Here i had an error: 
unable to resolve %any, initiate aborted
tried to checkin and delete nonexisting IKE_SA
establishing connection 'net-net' failed

5.Road warrior:
If the VPN configuration works, you test on RW_ALICE if you can ping 172.16.0.2.
